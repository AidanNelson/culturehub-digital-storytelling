A: I think I’ve been here before, I recognize that stretch of mountain, I’m…

B: Everywhere we go, you always think you’ve been here before. Those aren’t mountains, those are #place#, you’re still convinced, after all this time. We’re here. Look around, look around at where we are right now. We’re #dreampresent#

A: Well, it feels more like #dreampresent#

B: Well, it’s definitely not a place you’ve been before. 

A: No, No, this is different, I swear. I remember coming here with #person# and just — looking. 

B: Looking?

A: Looking.

B: For? 

A: Well, for — something I can’t quite remember now. It’s like
It’s like when you’re moving along a busy sidewalk, and you’re in the river of people around you just minding your own business and then — you hear #sound# and even though your body keeps going down that sidewalk your brain snaps back 5, 10, 20 years and you’re a child again and you’re moving through #place# and above the sound of #sound# all around you, you hear the voice of your mother, or maybe it’s your best friend, or #lovedOne# calling you back home. It’s like — as if — 

B: Do you hear that voice now? 

A: no, it’s like — like my memory snaps into place and it feels so far away it almost becomes a sort of dream. Or — maybe a #whatIsADream# or a #whatIsADream# or a #whatIsADream#. 

B: Oh

A: Or maybe it’s some sort of question. 

B: I don’t — I don’t usually remember my dreams. 

A: No?

B: No.
…
B: Well, except —
I used to have this recurring dream where #dreampast#,
and #dreampast#,
 and #dreampast#.

And everything was #color# — or maybe it was black and white? No, I think it was actually #color#.

And — have you ever had a dream that was so real, it felt like it was actually happening? 

A takes a sip, shrugs. 

B: Or — have you ever gotten lost in a dream? 

A: Well — do you think dreams can come true?

B: I don’t know. I don’t know. 

But I can’t help but feel like there’s something that I’m just — forgetting.

A: I think it helps to imagine something else. 

B: Like?

A: Like… #dreamfuture#

Or #dreamfuture#

Or even #dreamfuture#

B: I don’t get it.

A: Here — just, try this. 
Okay.
Close your eyes. 
Take a second.
What do you see? 

B: Oh. 
Oh. 
I remember now.
